Introduction of the structure

BSE_module: 
    Purposes: calculate the band structure of IX from BSE

    Flow: 
    1. band strucrture of single layer and its k-space representation
    2. Generate and diagonalize the BSE matrix to get the IX energy levels and wavefunctions

    Functions:
    1. Class for single layer band structure
    2. Generate and diagonalize the matrix for each Q of IX
    3. Plot wavefunctions to show the localization of the images in real- or k- space
    4. Plot high-symmetrical points of band structure for illustration
    5. dump eigenstates for record and further use?

Fit_module:
    Purposes: fit the IX band to get tight-banding model parameters.

    Flow ? 
    Functions:
    1. output the hopping parameters

Transport_module:
    Purposes: calculate all the transport elements for the IX

    Flow: 

    Functions:
